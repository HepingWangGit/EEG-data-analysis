# Background
EEG data analysis for alcohol association with brain activity
EEG measures brain's electrical activity via metal electrodes on the scalp, reflecting continuous cell communication and appearing as wavy lines. It's primarily used to diagnose epilepsy and can assist in detecting other brain disorders.

# Project introduction
The EEG data was collected from a large observational clinical study and the purpose of this study was to investigate the electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of brain activity to alcoholism. 

It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on subject's scalps. The EEG signals were sampled at a frequency of 256 Hz, with a 3.9-msec epoch for a duration of 1 second

The study included two groups of participants, namely, alcoholic and control. The participants were exposed to either a single stimulus (S1) or to two stimuli (S1 and S2), which were selected from the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. In the case of two stimuli, they were presented in either a matched condition, where S1 was identical to S2, or in a non-matched condition, where S1 differed from S2.
